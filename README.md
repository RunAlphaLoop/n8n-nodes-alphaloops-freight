# n8n-nodes-alphaloops-freight

This is an [n8n](https://n8n.io/) community node for the [AlphaLoops FMCSA API](https://runalphaloops.com/fmcsa-api/docs). It lets you access US trucking carrier data — profiles, fleet, inspections, crashes, authority history, news, and contacts — directly inside your n8n workflows.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

## Prerequisites

You need an AlphaLoops API key. Sign up at [runalphaloops.com](https://runalphaloops.com) to get one, regardless of which installation path you take.

## Installation (n8n Hosted)

The hosted n8n does not allow installation of arbitrary third-party packages. We have submitted this package to n8n for review and will update this README when it is approved.

## Installation (Self Hosted n8n)

Follow the [installation guide](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/community-nodes/installation/) in the n8n community nodes documentation. There are two approaches, one for Docker and one for non-Docker; but both boil down to 

`npm install n8n-nodes-alphaloops-freight`

Once you've restarted n8n with the `n8n-nodes-alphaloops-freight` package installed:

1. Open your desired workflow and go to the `Credentials` tab:

</p>

2. You'll see `AlphaLoops` as an option, click the triple dots to `open`:

</p>

3. Enter your API key and save it.

4. At this point, you can inset AlphaLoops calls into your n8n workflows:
